The Disease-Informed Modelling, Methods, and Systems (DIMMS) Lab at York University is dedicated to developing advanced mathematical and computational tools for studying infectious diseases and related biological systems. Our research bridges theoretical mathematics, computational techniques, and real-world public health applications.

Our core research areas include:

1. Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) for Epidemiology
   - We develop neural-network-based approaches that integrate differential equation structures into machine learning models, enabling disease-informed predictions. This work focuses on blending mechanistic modeling with data-driven learning to improve forecasts of infectious disease dynamics.

2. Climate Change & Infectious Disease Modeling
   - We investigate how environmental factors such as temperature and precipitation influence the spread of infectious diseases. Our goal is to anticipate shifts in disease patterns under different climate change scenarios, aiding proactive public health planning.

3. Singular Perturbation Theory in Multiscale Models
   - We apply advanced perturbation techniques to analyze systems exhibiting multiple time scales. This research helps connect within-host biological processes to population-level outcomes in epidemiology.

4. Mathematical Immunology & Host–Pathogen Dynamics
   - We build mathematical models that describe the interactions between pathogens and the immune system. Our projects explore topics such as immune responses to parasites and viruses, contributing to better understanding of disease progression and treatment strategies.

5. One-Health & Zoonotic Disease Modeling
   - We develop multi-host models that integrate human, animal, and environmental health to study zoonotic diseases such as mpox (monkeypox). Our research includes spatial epidemiology and geostatistical methods to enhance disease prediction and control.

6. Viscosity Solutions to Hamilton–Jacobi Equations
   - Our theoretical research focuse on viscosity solutions for partial differential equations, particularly in the context of Hamilton–Jacobi equations. These tools are crucial for optimal control problems and forecasting disease spread.

Current Research Projects and Collaborations:

- Developing neural ODE-based models for predicting avian influenza outbreaks.
- Modeling sexually transmitted infections using agent-based and data-driven frameworks.
- Exploring spatial dynamics of zoonotic diseases like mpox using geostatistical and machine learning techniques.
- Studying immune system dynamics in dengue virus infections through differential equation models.
- Designing optimal vaccination strategies using stochastic epidemic models.
- Investigating climate-driven shifts in disease transmission patterns.

Our team consists of postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and undergraduate researchers working on diverse projects ranging from theoretical mathematical analysis to practical applications in public health. Recent lab publications have appeared in journals such as PLOS Computational Biology, BMJ Global Health, and PLOS ONE, demonstrating our commitment to impactful, interdisciplinary research.
